  description: BDF containers are a very convenient and fast way to load-unload
    cargo and transport it. As you know, BDF containers are very often used in
    the postal and parcel services sector. Container transport is a very popular
    and common service, as the same containers can often be used for both water
    and land transport. As much as 90% of cargo (excluding liquid and bulk) is
    transported in containers. While the quality of service depends on many
    things, e.g. service, speed, good offers, etc., there are certain quality
    standards, one of them is ISO 900, this is one of the quality management
    standards. The standard includes both procedures related to the business
    process and the storage of documents, as well as the pursuit of good results
    and perfection. Checking for and correcting defects is only part of what
    lies behind the words "ISO". We are happy to offer services that meet
    quality standards.
