  description: Tilt trailers allow you to load the cargo as you like. Sometimes
    you have to use containers with open tops covered by a tarpaulin. This is a
    particularly convenient way to easily load the good from above. Metal, wood
    and other similar things can be perfectly transported with the help of
    tarpaulin loads. They allow you to load, unload and transport loads of
    different sizes, dimensions and weights. According to European standards,
    all semi-trailers have the option of loading from the rear, side or over. It
    can hold 33 euro pallets and the volume is up to 92 m2. The load is secured
    by eight struts and twelve lashing straps. All this guarantees strength,
    safety and high standards when transporting cargo.
